# Maritime-Decarbonisation-Project
This is a repository for my work in the maritime decarbonisation project, led by Dr Chai Kah-Hin at at the Industrial Systems Engineering and Management (ISEM) Department, National University of Singapore (NUS).

In this project, I automated Python scripts to visualise ship movements across the globe and the corresponding carbon emission patterns. The work is mostly done using the folium package.
